# Testcase Example:  '"abcabcbb"'
#
# Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating
# characters.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: "abcabcbb"
# Output: 3 
# Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: "bbbbb"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: "pwwkew"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
# ⁠            Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a
# subsequence and not a substring.

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        length = len(s)
        i = 0
        j = 0
        dic = {}
        ans = 0
        while (i < length and j < length):
            if s[j] not in dic:
                dic[s[j]] = 0
                j += 1
                ans = max(ans, j - i)
            else:
                del(dic[s[i]])
                i += 1
        return ans
